## Description

The purpose of this specific software is to provide a platform to those such gardeners who want to build their dream gardens but do not have enough capital for it, so they can post their incentives using our story posting feature and other users can donate to that gardener if they find the gardener trustworthy and genuine.

- The motivation behind working on this project is to teach myself mobile development using flutter as well as to evolve my ideas into a working application.
